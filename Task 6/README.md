# Task 6: VPC Peering Using Two AWS Accounts

For improved isolation, security, and management, resources are frequently dispersed across several AWS accounts in real-world cloud architectures. AWS has a powerful feature called *VPC Peering* that allows two *Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)* to communicate with each other, even if they are part of different AWS accounts.

This task involves establishing *VPC Peering* between two VPCs, each of which is housed in a different AWS account. Creating VPCs, setting up subnets, connecting Internet Gateways (IGWs), and creating a *Peering Connection* that permits private communication between instances in one VPC and instances in the other are the steps involved.

To route traffic through the peering connection, *Route Tables* in both VPCs must be updated after the peering request is approved. In order to allow communication, *Security Groups* must also allow ICMP or other required protocols.

By avoiding the public internet and facilitating smooth networking between apps or services operating across various AWS accounts, this configuration improves *security* and *latency*. It is particularly helpful in shared services models between teams or organizational units, hybrid environments, and microservices architectures.
