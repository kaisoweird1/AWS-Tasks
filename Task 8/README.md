# AWS S3 Bucket Creation using CLI

For managing storage in the cloud, **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** provides scalable object storage. This task involves creating an **S3 Bucket** using the **AWS CLI** to store and manage data efficiently.

To create an S3 bucket using the AWS CLI, the following steps are involved:

1. **Install and Configure AWS CLI**: Ensure that the AWS CLI is installed and configured with the necessary access keys.
2. **Create a New S3 Bucket**: Use the `aws s3api create-bucket` command to create the bucket. Specify a globally unique name and an AWS region.
3. **Verify the Bucket**: Confirm the creation of the S3 bucket by listing all buckets using the `aws s3 ls` command.

By using the **AWS CLI** to create and manage S3 buckets, this process streamlines data storage, making it scalable and secure without needing to access the AWS console.
